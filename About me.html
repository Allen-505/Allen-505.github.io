          <p>Many successful entrepreneurs have dropped out of college or never attended college at all, and have instead pursued their passions and used their skills and talents to create successful businesses & I'm one among them.

            Starting a business can be a challenging and risky endeavor, but with hard work, dedication, and a good business plan, it is possible to achieve success. Running an exotic pet business, such as "David's Exotics," could be a rewarding and exciting business venture for someone who is passionate about animals and has a strong understanding of the care and handling of exotic pets.
            
            Running a Exotic pet business can be a demanding and time-consuming job, as it involves caring for the animals, managing the business, and interacting with customers. It may also require knowledge of relevant laws and regulations related to the sale and care of exotic animals.
            
            Overall, it is important for any aspiring entrepreneur to be passionate about their business, stay focused, motivated, and be willing to take risks and put in the hard work needed to get succeed</p>
